          We believe in the attainability of clean and cost-efficient energy from sustainable sources for our communities that will provide workforce education and training for jobs with living wages.
          To achieve this, we will:

        <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            The Climate Reality Project: Western New York Chapter was formed in 2020 to address the unique environmental concerns of the Great Lakes/Rust Belt cities of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and Rochester and their suburbs and also in the rural areas in between, which have a diverse population in terms of race/ethnicity and income. Historically, Niagara Falls was one of the largest chemical producers in the world. Buffalo was once well-known for its steel industry. Rochester historically is known as the home of Kodak, Xerox and 3M. With these industries downsized or gone, local populations need workforce education and training for sustainable jobs. The area has endured a history of exposure to the toxic remnants of previous generations. Populations most affected by industrial pollution include indigenous peoples, low-income families, people of color, and other historically marginalized groups.

            This area is also one of great beauty and natural wonders. As such, the tourism industry has an important role to play in the local economy. Preservation of these natural wonders is key to our region.

          <h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
          <p>
            Western New York Climate Reality acknowledges Indigenous Peoples as the traditional stewards of the land, and the enduring relationship that exists between them and their traditional territories. The land on which we sit is the traditional unceded territory of the Haudenosaunee/Six Nations Confederacy. We acknowledge the painful history of genocide and forced occupation of their territory, and we honor and respect the many diverse indigenous people connected from time immemorial to this land on which we gather.

        <h3>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice Statement</h3>
        <p>
          At The Climate Reality Project, we are committed to building a more just and equitable world, one where all voices are heard and respected regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or physical ability.
        </p>
        <p>
        We recognize that a diverse and inclusive movement is critical to solving the climate crisis, and that to build this winning coalition, we must ensure that those directly impacted – particularly those who have been excluded in the past – are at the center of the movement for change. While the climate crisis manifests on a global scale, we acknowledge that indigenous peoples, low- income families, people of color, and other historically marginalized groups represent frontline communities who experience harmful climate impacts first and worst.
        </p>
        <p>
          To live our values of a truly sustainable future for all, we must commit to understanding and undoing the historic injustices which contribute to this reality and, in our solutions, address systemic inequities.
        </p>
        <p>
          At The Climate Reality Project, we believe that equity, fairness, and the fully voiced engagement of frontline communities most impacted by climate change are essential components of any enduring climate solution and that to solve the climate crisis, we must pursue a just transition to a clean energy economy that nurtures healthy and sustainable communities and ecosystems.

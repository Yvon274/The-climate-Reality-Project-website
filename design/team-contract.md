# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - attend planned meetings
    - complete works that were assigned before the due time
    - support and listen to each other
    - team members try best of the abilities in completing the client website


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - if a team member texts in the group chat, the other group members must respond **within two hours** of that chat being sent (exception: texting between 1:00-8:00AM because people need to sleep)
    - if team comes up with a due time, works assigned to individuals **must be completed** unless cleared with the group in special cases in advanced
    - team members should **attend all planned meetings** unless cleared with the group in special cases
    - team members can and should feel comfortable asking for help from each other
    - **don't shut down peoples ideas before thinking them over**


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - meet **at least once a week** (in person if possible) to assess where we are in the project and to make progress on our site designing process (i.e. meeting up to discuss how to write the design journey or how to implement CSS)
    - team will communicate as frequently as we need to using a group chat on **iMessage**


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - team appoints **one team member (Julianna)** as the main point of contact for our client
    - Julianna will communicate with the client via email and/or iMessage (sticking with email for now but she has exchanged phone numbers with Teresa just in case)
    - team gives client advanced notice of when we would like to meet with them over **Zoom** for discussions that require more than an email chain


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    - **Client Communicator**: this role is responsible for being the main point of communication between our team and our client; they are the ones sending the emails, setting up Zoom calls in accordance to everyone's availability, etc.
    - **Note takers**: this role is responsible for being the main source of notes when talking with client over Zoom
    - **Proof Reader/Organizer**: this role will check over the HTML/CSS/JavaScript thoroughly after each team member has completed coding their assigned works to make sure there are no errors that were overlooked when writing
    - **Submit Checker**: this role will check and make sure everything submitted properly


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - we will hold each other accountable by referring to this contract in instances where we feel someone is not doing what they need/said they would do
    - we will communicate with the team member who does not appear to be contributing equally/who fails to deliver what was promised in the attempt to solve the problem
    - note that we will not shame a team member for not doing what they should be doing - we will be understanding towards their circumstances yet firm in our plan to complete the site


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - we look at everyone's respective sides and agree to disagree(compromise) so that we can move further in the project as a team.
    - **communicate**


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - team re-visits this contract if any team member is not doing what was agreed that they do
    - team re-visits this contract if there's a violation to anything mentioned in this contract
    - team specifies the observed problems/violations and refers to specific "bullet points"
    - team revise the contract if unexpected problems/violations occur


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    - let's have a celebratory meal after this project is over!!!


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.

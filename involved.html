        <p class="interested">Here are some recent success stories about how we've been making a difference!</p>
        <h3 class = "tab4-header"> Danskammer’s Title V air permit</h3>
        <p>Two requests to build new natural gas plants in Danskammer and Astoria have been a concern for those communities and New York State in general.  Allowing these new plants to be built would have violated the 2019 CLCPA (Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act).</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Oct. 29th, <strong>NY’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) announced that they would deny Danskammer’s Title V air permit.</strong> DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos stated that the proposed Danskammer project was not consistent with the requirements of the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), specifically its greenhouse gas reduction goals. The project cannot move forward without this permit, so this is the end of the road for Danskammer (though they do have the right to appeal the decision). DEC also denied air permits for another gas plant in Astoria and stated that, <strong>“The continued long-term use of fossil fuels to produce electricity... is inconsistent with the State’s laws and objectives.”</strong> Both of these facilities would have had major impacts on environmental justice communities. This is a major win for the New York environmental community. Thanks to all the Climate Reality Leaders who emailed, called and tweeted Gov. Hochul, their state representatives and DEC Commissioner Seggos. Your efforts helped make this possible!</p>

        <h3 class = "tab4-header"> Proposition 2</h3>
        <p>In the most recent election, New Yorkers resoundingly supported our <strong>right to “clean air, clean water and a healthful environment.”</strong> Almost two million people (69% of voters) took a stand for the environment by voting “Yes” on Proposal 2 on November 2nd! <strong>This adds the right to clean air and water and a healthy environment to the Constitution of New York State. Thanks to all the CRP Leaders who posted on social media to spread the word!</strong></p>
        <h3 class = "tab4-header"> 100% Committed</h3>
        <p>100% Committed is a grassroots campaign, spearheaded by Climate Reality Chapters, pushing universities, towns, cities, counties, and local businesses to commit to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030 (excluding heating, cooling, and transportation), striving to rely on renewable sources whenever possible. In order to build momentum for a broad systemic change that shifts away from fossil fuels and towards a more fair and sustainable society, switching to clean electricity is essential.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 1, 2021, the Western New York Chapter had its first 100% Committed victory!  Sinclair Pharmacy in Warsaw signed the pledge to go sustainable by switching to 100% renewable electricity by 2030.  Congratulations to Pharmacist James Rutowski for his dedication to a sustainable future!</p>
        <p>With the passage of the CLCPA in 2019, NY State committed to 100% renewable electricity by 2040. Signing the 100% Committed pledge pushes that goal forward by 10 years.  Join clean electricity leaders in your area to make a sustainable future a reality in Western New York!</p>

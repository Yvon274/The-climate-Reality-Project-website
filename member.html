        <h2>Meet Jennifer Fendya</h2>
        <p>"I’ve worked in WNY as a licensed psychologist for 20+ years and suddenly had to shift my in-person practice online at the start of the COVID pandemic in early March, 2020. A few weeks later I registered for the Climate Reality Project NY State Coalition's online retreat and spent that weekend getting inspired to join an even larger group of informed international citizens taking climate action. I soon became part of the newly-formed Western NY Chapter's leadership team even before I did my CRP training, also online, in April 2021.</p>
        <p>During the difficult months of personal separation from most other humans and in the global context of extreme and ongoing intersectional injustices and biodiversity loss, my time outdoors with the more-than-human world was literally a 'saving grace.' I've deepened my ongoing practices of nature connection (I’ve been a Forest Therapy guide since 2018) and contemplative photography (Nalanda Miksang) and also recently joined the Climate Psychology Alliance, whose tagline is 'Facing Difficult Truths.' In each of these different yet interrelated ways I feel privileged to be here now, becoming more fully present to what’s happening in our world, noticing and cultivating response-ability in myself and others."</p>
